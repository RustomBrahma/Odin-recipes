  <!--Ingredients-->
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water (or as needed)</li>
      <li>1/2 lb ground meat (chicken, pork, or beef)</li>
      <li>1 cup finely chopped vegetables (cabbage, carrots, and onions)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 inch ginger, minced</li>
      <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>

  <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and water. Mix until a dough forms. Knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>In a separate bowl, combine the ground meat, chopped vegetables, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, vegetable oil, salt, and pepper. Mix well to create the filling.</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into small, equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into a thin circle about 3 inches in diameter.</li>
      <li>Place a small amount of filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold the dough over the filling and pinch the edges together to seal the dumpling. Repeat until all the dough and filling are used.</li>
      <li>Heat a steamer and lightly oil the steamer basket. Place the dumplings in the basket, making sure they do not touch each other.</li>
      <li>Steam the dumplings for about 10-12 minutes, or until the dough is cooked through and the filling is hot.</li>
      <li>Serve the momo dumplings hot, garnished with chopped cilantro if desired, and with a side of spicy dipping sauce.</li>
